Product Categories:

    They are managed in kakocase application, so that all kakocase sites share the same categories. When a
    category is created in an operator website, it is sent back to ikwen umbrella database. Thus, next kakocase
    websites are setup with all categories that were previously created by Operators of that specific BusinessCategory.
    Whenever a category is created, it is appended to the product_categories of the current operator BusinessCategory


Billing:
    IAO should not be allowed to add Payment for retailed services on Kakocase because the sharing of money
    won't be possible.


OperatorProfile:
    1 - Create Operator Wallet in WALLETS Database then copy the id in the rel_id field of OperatorProfile in NoSQL Datastore
    2 - DeliveryMan profile must absolutely use the same currency as the Provider or Retailer.
    3 - media_url field must be set for Providers


ConsoleEventType:
    Upon deployment make sure app_id matches the Application id. This to avoid taking a local application id online
    and not matching it to the online ConsoleEventType.
